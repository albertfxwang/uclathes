cluster \clyi}

\section{Introduction}\label{sect:intro}

Galaxies are complex ecosystems, particularly at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation,
corresponding to the redshift range of $z$$\sim$1-3, also known as the ``cosmic noon''
\citep[see][for a recent review]{2014ARA&A..52..415M}.  During this approximately 4 Gyr, the
Hubble sequence gradually breaks down and the predominant morphology of galaxies transforms
from irregular systems at high redshifts to symmetric disks and bulges at low redshifts
\citep{Mortlock:2013dg}.  This complexity is to a large extent induced by the interplay
between the process of star formation, and the diverse aspects of baryonic cycling, \eg,
galactic feedback, gas inflows/outflows, and major/minor mergers
\citep{2011MNRAS.415...11D,Martin:2012dx}.  The effect of environment surrounding galaxies
can further complicate the spatial distribution of star formation, as recently revealed by
\citet{2015ApJ...814..161V,TheGrismlensampli:-R7Qg0z6}.
Measurements of gas-phase metallicity, \ie, the chemical abundances of elements heavier than
hydrogen and helium in the interstellar medium (ISM), are a powerful means to shed light on
this complexity,
because the metal enrichment history is strongly tied to the mass assembly history in galaxy evolution
\citep{2011MNRAS.416.1354D,Lu:2015ic}.  Since detailed elemental abundances are not directly measurable at extragalactic
distances, the relative oxygen abundance in ionized gaseous nebulae, \ie, \oh, is often chosen as the observational proxy of
metallicity.

For over a decade, a tight correlation between metallicity and galaxy stellar mass (\Mstar),
\ie, the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), has been quantitatively established, from the vast
database of local galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
\citep{Tremonti:2004ed,Zahid:2012fp,Andrews:2013dn}. This relation has been further extended to high redshifts, using
deep near infrared (IR) spectroscopy facilitated by large ground-based and space-based
telescopes \citep{Erb:2006kn,2008A&A...488..463M,Zahid:2011bb,Henry:2013gx,2014ApJ...795..165S,Sanders:2015gk,Guo:2016wk}.
The measurements of the MZR as a function of redshift can cast useful constraints on various galaxy evolution models, since the
slope of the MZR is sensitive to the properties of outflows, such as the mass loading factor and the outflow speed \citep[see,
\eg,][]{2012MNRAS.421...98D,Lu:2015kh}.
This slope can also be explained by variations of star-formation efficiency and gas mass fraction in galaxies with different
stellar masses \citep[see, \eg,][]{Baldry:2008hm,TheUniversalRelati:2014kx}.
The normalization of the MZR can shed light upon the stellar chemical yield across cosmic time \citep{2008MNRAS.385.2181F}.
\citet{2010MNRAS.408.2115M} first suggested that there exists a so-called fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) in
the 3D parameter space spanned by \Mstar, \sfr (SFR), and metallicity, such that the MZR is merely a 2D projection of this more
fundamental 3D manifold \citep[see also][]{Hunt:2016ui}.
This 3D scaling relation shows a tight scatter ($\sim$0.05 dex) in metallicity and is speculated to not evolve with $z$.
In this context, the apparent redshift evolution of the MZR normalization originates primarily from sampling the FMR in terms of
galaxies with different SFR. This concept of the FMR is in accord with the gas regulator model proposed by \citet{Lilly:2013ko}, 
even though mergers can also play a subtle role in shaping the form of the FMR by increasing the scatter 
\citep{MichelDansac:2008gp}. However, at high redshifts, the validity of the FMR is still under investigation \citep[see, 
\eg,][]{Sanders:2015gk,Wuyts:2014ed}.

Spatially resolved chemical information provides a more powerful diagnostic tool about galaxy baryonic assembly than
integrated metallicity measurements, especially at high redshifts. Because for non-interacting galaxies, their metallicity radial 
gradients are found to be highly sensitive to the properties of gas, \ie, the surface density, the existence of inflows/outflows, and the kinematic
structure \citep{Cresci:2010hr,2013ApJ...765...48J,2014A&A...563A..49S,Metallicityevolutio:2014kg}.
In the past few years, metallicity radial gradients, measured from spectroscopic data
acquired by ground-based instruments with natural seeing ($\gtrsim$$0\farcs6$), have been
reported at high redshifts
\citep{Queyrel:2012hw,Metallicityevolutio:2014kg,2014MNRAS.443.2695S}. In particular, a large
mass-selected sample of galaxies at $0.7\lesssim z\lesssim2.7$ were observed with spatially
resolved gas kinematics and star formation, using the K-band Multi Object Spectrograph
(\kmos) on the Very Large Telescope (\vlt) \citep[\ie, the \kd
survey,][]{2015ApJ...799..209W}.  As a result, \citet{Wuyts:2016th} measured \mgs for 180 \sf
galaxies in three redshift intervals (\ie [0.8, 1.0], [1.3, 1.7], and [2.0, 2.6]), and found
that the majority of the \mgs are flat and no statistical significant correlations between
\mgs, and stellar, kinematic, and structural properties of the galaxy.

However, seeing-limited measurements typically have insufficient resolution to resolve the inner structure of galaxies at
$z\gtrsim1$, and the inferred metallicity gradient can be potentially biased. For example, \citet{2013ApJ...767..106Y} showed that
coarse spatial sampling ($\geq$1 \kpc) can result in artificially flat \mgs, inferring that sufficiently high spatial resolution,
\ie, \emph{sub-kpc} scale (corresponding to an angular resolution of $<0\farcs2$-$0\farcs3$), is crucial in yielding precise
information of how metals are distributed spatially in extragalactic \HII regions.  Only a few \mgms meet this requirement,
including a sample of 9 \Ha-selected galaxies at $z\in[0.84,2.23]$ (the majority at $z\sim1.45$), observed with the adaptive
optics (AO) assisted integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph \sinf onboard the \vlt \citep{2012MNRAS.426..935S}. Even higher
resolution can be attained through the combination of diffraction-limited data and gravitational lensing as shown by
\citet{2010ApJ...725L.176J,2013ApJ...765...48J,Yuan:2011hj}, targeting strongly lensed galaxies with the laser guide star AO aided
IFU spectrograph \osiris at the \keck telescope. Following this approach, \citet{2015arXiv150901279L} recently analyzed a sample
of 11 lensed galaxies (3 at $z\sim1.45$ and the rest at $z\gtrsim2$), deriving maps of both metallicity and emission line (EL)
kinematics.  Although a great amount of effort has been invested in enlarging the sample size of high-$z$ \mgs obtained with
sub-kpc scale spatial resolution, the current sample consists of only $\lesssim30$ such gradients and is still statistically
insufficient to explore trends with stellar mass and redshift.

In order to enlarge the sample of sub-kpc resolution measurements, we recently demonstrated that such metallicity maps can be
derived using space-based data \citep{2015AJ....149..107J}. We measured a flat metallicity gradient in a multiply lensed
interacting system at $z=1.85$, using diffraction-limited Hubble Space Telescope (\hst) grism data, and confirmed that flat \mgs 
can be caused by gravitational interactions in merging systems.

The main goal of the work presented here is to collect a uniformly analyzed large sample of high-$z$ metallicity maps obtained
with sub-kpc spatial resolution. To meet our goal, we improve upon the methodology proposed in our pilot paper
\citep{2015AJ....149..107J}, in particular via developing a novel Bayesian method to imply metallicity from multiple EL
diagnostics simultaneously. We apply our advanced analysis to ultra-deep grism data of the massive galaxy cluster \clyi, thus
exploiting the powerful synergy of \hst diffraction-limited spectroscopy and lensing magnification.

The outline of this Chapter is as follows. In Section~\ref{sect:spec}, we introduce the spectroscopic observations used in this work
and the selection of our \mg sample. The photometric data and galaxy cluster lens models are briefed in Section~\ref{sect:phot}.
We then present our entire analysis process in Section~\ref{sect:analysis}, and show our results in terms of global demographics
and spatially resolved analysis in Sections~\ref{sect:global} and \ref{sect:sra}, respectively.  Finally,
Section~\ref{sect:conclu} will conclude and discuss our study. The concordance cosmological model (\Om=0.3, \Ol=0.7,
$H_0=70\Hunit$) and the AB magnitude system \citep{1983ApJ...266..713O} are used throughout.  Without specific number
showing the wavelength, the names of forbidden lines are simplified as $\OII~\lambda\lambda3726,3729\defeq\OII$,
$\OIII~\lambda5008\defeq\OIII$, $\NII~\lambda6585\defeq\NII$, $\SII~\lambda\lambda6718,6732\defeq\SII$\footnote{The
wavelength values are taken from \url{http://classic.sdss.org/dr7/algorithms/linestable.html}}.


\section{Spectroscopic Data and Sample Selection}\label{sect:spec}

In Section~\ref{subsect:hstdata}, we summarize our \hst grism observations, data quality, and data reduction.
Our sample selection criteria are then described in Section~\ref{subsect:srcselect}.
We also carried out some ground-based integral field unit (IFU) observations on part of our sample, which are presented in 
Appendix~\ref{sect:kinem}.
%In Section~\ref{subsect:ifu}, we summarize the ground based kinematic data that we will use to supplement and interpret the
%metallicity and star formation maps obtained from the \hst grism spectroscopy.

\subsubsection{The Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space}\label{subsect:glass}

The Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space\footnote{\url{http://glass.astro.ucla.edu}} \citep[\glass; Proposal ID 13459;
P.I. Treu,][]{2014ApJ...782L..36S,2015ApJ...812..114T} is an \hst cycle 21 large general observing (GO) program.  \glass
observed 10 massive galaxy
clusters with the Wide Field Camera 3 Infrared (WFC3/IR) grisms (G102 and G141; 10 and 4 orbits per cluster,
respectively) targeted at their centers and the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) Optical grism (G800L) at their infall
regions.
The exposure on each cluster core is split into two nearly orthogonal
position angles (PAs), in order to disentangle contamination from neighboring objects.
Data acquisition was completed in January 2015. Here we focus on the grism data targeted on the center of
\clyi taken in February 2014 (PA=$032^{\circ}$) and November 2014 (PA=$125^{\circ}$), marked by blue squares in
Figure~\ref{fig:RGBfullFoV} (also see Table~\ref{tab:obsdata}). \glass provides $\sim$10\% of the G141
exposures used in this work, and 100\% of the G102 exposures.  Details on \glass data reduction can be found in
\citet{2014ApJ...782L..36S,2015ApJ...812..114T}.

\begin{figure}

    \caption[Color composite image of \clyi from the full-depth 7-filter \hff photometry.]{Color composite image of \clyi from the full-depth 7-filter \hff photometry.
    The blue, green, and red channels are comprised of the \hst broad-band filters shown on
    the right. The blue, red and green squares mark the footprints of \glass, the Refsdal
    follow-up, and \muse programs utilized in this work.  The cyan contours are the critical
    curves at $z=1.8$ predicted by the \glafic version 3 lens model.
    The critical curves denote the regions where lensing magnification reaches infinity.
    Thus the closer proximity between the object and the critical curve at the object's redshift indicates higher magnification
    that the object has.
    The magenta circles show the positions of our \mg sample. 3$\times$3 arcsec$^2$ zoom-in postage stamps around
    these positions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RGBstamps}.
    \label{fig:RGBfullFoV}}
\end{figure}

Shallow images through filters F105W or F140W were taken to aid the
alignment and extraction of grism spectra. The imaging exposures are
combined with the exposures obtained by the Hubble Frontier
Fields (\hff) initiative and other programs to produce the deep
stacks, released as part of the \hff program (see Section~\ref{sect:phot}
for more details).

\subsubsection{The Supernova Refsdal Follow-up Program with \protect\hst G141}\label{subsect:refsdal}

The majority of the G141 exposures used in this work (30 orbits) were taken as part of the follow-up \hst GO/DDT
campaign (Proposal ID 14041, P.I. Kelly, Brammer et al. in prep.) of the first multiply
imaged supernova, SN Refsdal \citep{2015Sci...347.1123K}. Two pointings
(shown by the red squares in Figure~\ref{fig:RGBfullFoV}) were exposed between December 2014 and January 2015 with 8 degrees apart
(\ie
at PA=$111^{\circ}$, and $119^{\circ}$ respectively, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:obsdata}), in order to optimize the spectroscopy
of SN Refsdal.  The analysis of the
spectra of SN Refsdal, which showed that it was SN 1987A-like, is described by \citet{2015arXiv151209093K}.

\subsubsection{Grism Data Reduction}

The combined grism dataset was reduced following the procedure of the
3D-\hst survey \citep{Brammer:2012bu,Momcheva:2016fr}. An updated
3D-\hst pipeline \footnote{\url{http://code.google.com/p/threedhst/}}
was employed to reduce the images and spectra. The \adriz software
from the \dpac package and \verb+tweakreg+ were used to align and
combine individual grism exposures, subtracting the sky images
provided by \citet{Brammer:2012bu}. The time-varying sky background
due to helium glow (at 10,830 \AA) in the Earth exosphere was also
accounted for according to \citet{Brammer:2014wl}. After these initial
steps, the mosaics were co-added through interlacing onto a grid of
0\farcs065 resolution, Nyquist sampling the point spread function (PSF)
full width half maximum (FWHM).  The average spectral resolution is $R$$\sim$210
and $R$$\sim$130 for G102 and G141, respectively. The average pixel scale
after interlacing is 12 \AA{} and 22 \AA{} respectively for G102 and G141.

We used the co-added \H-band mosaics as the detection image, on which \sex
was run. An object catalog was generated and a
corresponding segmentation map was created for each object,
determining which spatial pixels (spaxels) belong to this object. Thus for a source
registered in the catalog and falling within the WFC3 grism field-of-view (FoV), we
extracted its spectra from grism mosaics through adding up the
dispersed flux for all spaxels within an area defined by the
segmentation image of this source, after flat-field correction and
background subtraction.  The ``fluxcube'' model from the \axe package
\citep{Kummel:2009dn} was employed to generate the 2D models of stellar
spectrum, based upon the spatial profile of the source, the color
information from direct image mosaics (if available), and the grism
calibration configurations.  For sources of interest, this model
serves as the continuum model which we re-scaled and subtracted from
the observed 2D spectra (see Section~\ref{subsect:combELmaps} for more
details) in order to obtain pure EL maps. At the same time, if the object is a bright contaminating neighbour,
this 2D model also functions as spectral contamination, which is subtracted before the continuum removal.

The data used in this work contain a total of 34 orbits of G141 and 10 orbits of G102,
reaching a 1-$\sigma$ flux limit (uncorrected for lensing magnification) of 3.5(1.2)$\times$$10^{-18}$ \Funit over the wavelength
range of G102(G141), calculated from \citet{Schmidt:2016ez}. Our data provide an uninterrupted wavelength coverage in the range of
0.8-1.7 \micron and make this particular field one of the deepest fields probed by \hst spectroscopy to date.

\end{landscape}

The selection of our \mg sample is based upon the master redshift
catalog for \clyi\footnote{available at \url{https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/glass/}}, published by the \glass collaboration.
As described by \citet{2015arXiv151005750T}, redshifts were determined by combining
spectroscopic information from \glass and the SN Refsdal follow-up \hst
grism programs, ground-based \muse observations and Keck \deimos data.

    image shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RGBfullFoV}. In each stamp, we also show the spectroscopic
    redshift, stellar mass and lensing magnification (best-fit value followed by 1-$\sigma$
    confidence interval) of the galaxy.
    In the panel of ID 02806, we use the white arrow to point to our galaxy of interest (ID
    02806). All stamps are on the same spatial scale. The 1\arcsec scale bar and north-east
    compass are shown in the lower right corner.}
    \label{fig:RGBstamps}
\end{figure}

For the purpose of this study, we compiled an exhaustive list of spatially extended sources with secure spectroscopic redshift
measurements in the range of $z\in[1.2, 2.3]$, showing strong ELs (primarily \OIII and \Hb) in the 2D grism spectra.
The reason this redshift range is selected is that we require high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) detections of \OIII, \Hb and \OII 
ELs in the spectral region where grism sensitivity and throughput do not drop significantly, in order to deliver reliable 
metallicity estimates from well-calibrated EL diagnostics\footnote{The \Ha EL is only accessible in sources at $z\leq1.5$ in our 
sample. The \glass spectra of an exemplary galaxy whose \Ha is covered are displayed in Appendix~\ref{sect:ELflux}.}.
The selection results in a sample of 14 galaxies. The positions of these 14 galaxies relative to the cluster are denoted by the 
magenta circles in Figure~\ref{fig:RGBfullFoV}, while the postage stamp images of these galaxy are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:RGBstamps}.
The full sample is also listed in Table~\ref{tab:srcprop}.
In particular, one source in our sample, \ie, galaxy ID 04054, is one of the multiple images of SN Refsdal's host
galaxy (see Figure~\ref{fig:multiP_4054} for its appearances from
various perspectives). A steep metallicity gradient ($-0.16\pm0.02$
dex/kpc) has been previously measured on another multiple image of
this spiral galaxy \citep{Yuan:2011hj}. Our work is the first
\mgm on this particular image, which is least distorted/contaminated
by foreground cluster members. We also take advantage of a more
precise lens model of both the entire cluster and the SN Refsdal host,
from the extensive lens modeling effort summarized by \citet{2015arXiv151005750T}.

\section{Photometry and Lens Models from the \hff}\label{sect:phot}

The Hubble Frontier Fields
initiative\footnote{\url{http://www.stsci.edu/hst/campaigns/frontier-fields}} \citep[\hff;
P.I.  Lotz,][]{Lotz:2016ca} is an ongoing multi-cycle treasury program enabled by an \hst
director's discretionary time allocation. \hff targets the cores (prime fields) and infall regions (parallel fields)
of six massive galaxy clusters, reaching an ultra-faint intrinsic magnitude of 30-33, made possible by the synergy of diffraction
limited photometry and lensing magnification. The large wavelength coverage, uninterrupted from \B to \H passbands, is crucial for
photometric redshift determinations and stellar population synthesis.

Besides the deep image mosaics, the \hff collaboration also provides
the community with cluster lens models
\footnote{\url{http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/frontier/lensmodels/}}.
Several groups of scientists were invited prior to the beginning of
the campaign to provide independent models depicting the total mass distribution
of the six \hff clusters, using a number of distinct techniques.
As data accumulate and more multiply imaged systems are identified, the lens models are continuously improved.
For our cluster of interest, \clyi, the most up-to-date publicly available model is the \glafic version 3 model,
constructed using a simply parametrized method proposed by \citet{2010PASJ...62.1017O}.
For an in-depth description of the various modeling techniques, their advantages and limitations, we
refer to \citet{2015arXiv151005750T,Meneghetti:2016wg}.

In this work, we need lens models to trace the observed metallicity
maps back to the source plane. Following our previous work \citep{2015AJ....149..107J},
we experiment with several publicly available models to find the ones that give the
reconstruction of our target sources the highest fidelity (judging by
how well the source plane morphologies of multiply imaged sources
match each other). Based upon the SN Refsdal test (see also \citet{2015arXiv151204654K}),
the \glafic version 3 model \citep{2015arXiv151006400K}, the \textsc{Grillo} model \citep{2016ApJ...822...78G}, and
the \SJ version 3 model were the most accurate ones, so we considered those three.
As an illustration, the \glafic version 3 critical curves at $z=1.8$, the
median redshift of our \mg sample, are overlaid in cyan in Figure~\ref{fig:RGBfullFoV}.

The most highly magnified source in our sample is galaxy ID 02389, one of
the folded arcs which straddle the critical curve. For that particular
source, we used as our default the \SJ version 3 model, updated from the earlier versions
presented in \citet{Johnson:2014cf,Sharon:2015hr}. The \SJ version 3 model leads
to a more precise reconstruction of the source plane morphology of
galaxy ID 02389.  We also tested that switching entirely from the
\glafic version 3 model to the \SJ version 3 model does not affect our
measurements significantly, as also pointed out by \citet{2015arXiv150901279L}.
The lensing magnification results from the considered lens models are given in
Table~\ref{tab:srcprop}.


\section{Analysis Procedures}\label{sect:analysis}

Here we describe the stellar population synthesis analysis of our sample in
Section~\ref{subsect:sed}, and source plane morphology reconstruction in
Section~\ref{subsect:morph}.
The entire steps necessary for extracting EL maps from 2D grism spectra combined from
different PAs are detailed in Section~\ref{subsect:combELmaps}.
Our new Bayesian method to jointly infer metallicity, nebular dust extinction, and SFR from a
simultaneous use of multiple strong ELs is presented in Section~\ref{subsect:bayes}.

\subsection{Spectral Energy Distribution Fitting}\label{subsect:sed}

The full-depth 7-filter \hff photometry was fitted with the template spectra from
\citet{Bruzual:2003ck} using the stellar population synthesis code \fast
\citep{Kriek:2009cs}, in order to derive global estimates of stellar mass (\Mstar) and the
dust extinction of stellar continuum ($\Av^{\rm S}$) for each source in our sample. We take a
grid of stellar population parameters that include: exponentially declining star formation
histories with $e$-folding times ranging from 10~Myr to 10~Gyr, stellar ages ranging from 5~Myr to
the age of the universe at the observed redshift, and $\Av^{\rm S}$=0-4 magnitudes for a
\citet{Calzetti:2000iy} dust extinction law. We assume the \citet{Chabrier:2003ki}
initial mass function (IMF) and fix the stellar metallicity to solar.
Table~\ref{tab:srcprop} lists the best-fit \Mstar values, corrected for lensing
magnification.
Although the adopted solar metallicity is higher than the typical gas-phase abundances we
infer for the sample, this has little effect on the derived stellar mass. Fixing the stellar
metallicity to $1/5$ solar (i.e. $Z=0.004$ or $\oh=8.0$, corresponding to the sample median)
reduces the best-fit \Mstar by only $\sim0.03$ dex.

\subsection{Source Plane Morphology}\label{subsect:morph}

Measurements of metallicity gradients require knowledge of the galaxy center, major axis orientation, and inclination or
axis ratio. We derive these quantities from spatially resolved maps of the stellar mass surface density following the
methodology described in \citet{2015AJ....149..107J}. Briefly, we smooth the \hff photometric
images to a common point spread function of 0\farcs2 FWHM and fit the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of each spaxel using the same procedure described in
Section~\ref{subsect:sed}. The resulting \Mstar maps in the image plane are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:multiP_4054} and
\ref{fig:multiP_rest}. We reconstruct the \Mstar maps in the source plane using the adopted
lens models and determine the centroid, axis ratio, inclination and major axis orientation from a 2D
elliptical Gaussian fit to the \Mstar distribution. This allows us to measure the
galactocentric radius at each point, assuming that contours of \Mstar surface density
correspond to constant de-projected radius \citep[following][]{2015AJ....149..107J}. 

Since the following analysis is mostly done with the robust image plane data, we reconstruct
the derived radius maps in the image plane.
The contours of constant source-plane galactocentric radius for each galaxy in our sample are shown in 
Figures~\ref{fig:multiP_4054} and \ref{fig:multiP_rest}. Note that these contours are distorted from ellipses ascribed to the 
shear of gravitational lensing.
For nearly half of our sample where we have seeing-limited IFU data described in Appendix~\ref{sect:kinem}, we verify that for 
galaxies with significant rotation support (\eg IDs 05709 and 05968), the morphological major axis agrees at 2-$\sigma$ with
the pseudo-slit that maximizes velocity shear according to our kinematic analysis.

\subsection{Emission Line Maps from Grism Spectra}\label{subsect:combELmaps}

The broad grism wavelength coverage provides spatially resolved maps of multiple ELs,
such as \OII, \Hg, \Hb, \OIII, \Ha$+$\NII, and \SII.
The integrated fluxes of these ELs for our sample of galaxies are presented in Appendix~\ref{sect:ELflux}.
To obtain pure EL maps, we first use the \axe continuum models described in Section~\ref{sect:spec} to subtract contaminating
flux from neighboring sources. The continuum model for the target object is scaled to match
the locally observed levels, and then subtracted. We check that the flux residual in regions
near the ELs of interest follow a normal distribution with zero mean.

Due to the limited spectral resolution of \hst WFC3/IR grisms, \Hb and the \OIII$\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 doublets are
partially blended in the spatially extended sources. We adopt a direct de-blending technique
to separate these emission lines following the procedure used in \citet{2015AJ....149..107J}.
First, an isophotal contour is measured from the co-added \hst \H-band postage stamp,
typically at the level of $\sim$10 percent of the peak flux received from the source.
We then apply this contour to the 2D grism spectra at the observed wavelengths corresponding to
\OIII$\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 and \Hb, maximizing the flux given grism redshift uncertainty ($\sim$0.01).
We use the theoretical \OIII$\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 doublet flux ratio (\ie
\OIII$\lambda$5008/\OIII$\lambda$4960=2.98, calculated by \citet{Storey:2000jd}) to subtract
the flux contribution of \OIII$\lambda$4960 corresponding to the region where
\OIII$\lambda$5008 is unblended. We iterate this procedure to remove the \OIII$\lambda$4960
emission completely, resulting in pure maps of \Hb and \OIII$\lambda$5008.

Note that this direct de-blending will be compromised if the source is so extended that its
\OIII$\lambda$5008 and \Hb are blended. In practice, we fine-tune the isophotal contour level
to avoid this contamination. As a result, no cases in our sample have problem with our
direct de-blending method, and the resulting pure \OIII$\lambda$5008 and \Hb maps are
uncontaminated.

In the case of \Ha and \NII, the emission lines are separated by less than the grism spectral
resolution. Therefore we cannot use the direct technique to de-blend \Ha and \NII
emission, and instead treat the \NII/\Ha ratio as an unknown parameter in Section
\ref{subsect:bayes}.

After obtaining pure EL maps, we rotate the maps from each PA to the same orientation and then combine the data, in order 
to utilize the full depth of the grism exposures. We note that EL maps must first be extracted from grism spectra at each PA 
before being combined, in order to account for the different rotation and spectral resolution.
There are in total six different PA-grism combinations as given in Table~\ref{tab:obsdata}. At certain redshifts, ELs are
visible in the overlapping region between the two grisms at $\lambda\in[1.08,1.15]~\micron$
resulting in up to six individual maps of the same EL. We use the data taken at
PA=$119^{\circ}$ as a reference, as this minimizes errors arising from rotating the various
PAs into alignment. We first apply a small vertical offset to each EL map to account for the
slight tilt of the spectral trace (i.e. known offset between the dispersion direction and the
x-axis of extracted spectra; \citealt{Brammer:2012bu}). Next, we apply a small horizontal
shift to correct for uncertainties in the wavelength calibration and redshift. Finally we
rotate each EL map to align it with the reference orientation at PA=$119^{\circ}$.  The best
values of these three alignment parameters are found by maximizing the normalized
cross-correlation coefficient (NCCF) in order to achieve optimal alignment of multiple PAs:
\be\label{eq:ccf}
    \textrm{NCCF}=\frac{1}{n}\Sigma_{x,y}\frac{\(S_\refe(x,y)-\avg{S_\refe}\)\(S_\pa(x,y)-\avg{S_\pa}\)}{\sigma_{S_\refe}\sigma_{S_\pa}}.
\ee
Here $S$ is the \subr profile for a specific EL, $S_\refe$ corresponds to the reference
alignment stamp adopted as the PA=$119^{\circ}$ data, and $n$ is the number of spaxels in the
\subr profile. $\avg{S}$ and $\sigma_S$ represent the average and standard deviation of the
\subr, respectively.

Once the data from each PA are aligned, we vet the EL maps from each PA-grism combination and
reject those which show significant contamination-subtraction residuals or grism reduction defects.  We
combine the remaining maps of a given EL using an inverse variance weighted average
in order to properly account for the different exposure times and noise levels.
The final combined maps of each EL for each galaxy are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:multiP_4054} and
\ref{fig:multiP_rest}.

Generally speaking, two methods exist in deriving gas-phase oxygen abundance in star-forming galaxies at high redshifts.
``Direct'' determinations based on electron temperature measurements, which require high SNR
detections of auroral lines (\eg \OIII$\lambda$4364), are still extremely challenging beyond the local universe \citep[see][for a
rare example]{Sanders:2016uo}.
We therefore rely on the calibrations of strong collisionally excited EL flux ratios to estimate metallicities.

One of the most popular strong EL diagnostics is the flux ratio of \NII/\Ha calibrated by \citet{2004MNRAS.348L..59P}.  However, a
large offset (0.2-0.4 dex) between the loci of high-$z$ and present-day star-forming galaxies in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich
\citep[BPT,][]{Baldwin:1981ev} diagram has recently been discovered, indicating that extending the locally calibrated \NII/\Ha to
high-$z$ can be problematic \citep{2015ApJ...801...88S,Sanders:2015gk}.  The interpretation of this offset is still the topic of
much debate. It has been interpreted as the existence of a fundamental relation between nitrogen-oxygen abundance ratio and \Mstar
\citep{Masters:2016vr}, a systematic dependence of strong EL properties with respect to Balmer line luminosity
\citep{Cowie:2016fv}, a combination of harder ionizing radiation and higher ionization states of the ISM gas at high redshifts.
\citep{2014ApJ...795..165S,Steidel:2016wu}, or an enhancement of nitrogen abundance in hot \HII regions \citep{Pilyugin:2010bx}.  
Fortunately, the alpha-element BPT diagrams show no offset with $z$ \citep{2015ApJ...801...88S,Sanders:2015gk}, and therefore the 
diagnostics based upon those ELs are more reliable.

In this work we adopt the calibrations of \citet[M08]{2008A&A...488..463M}, including the flux ratios of \OIII/\Hb, \OII/\Hb,
\NII/\Ha.
Given the potential systematics related to nitrogen ELs, we do not use the \NII/\Ha calibration of M08.
M08 fit the relation between these EL ratios and gas-phase oxygen abundance based upon ``direct'' measurements (from
\OIII$\lambda$4364) for \oh$<8.3$, and photoionization model results for higher metallicities. This provides a continuous
framework valid over the wide range \oh$\in(7.1,9.2)$.  We note that although there are alternative calibrations of metallicity
available in the literature and the applicability of these recipes is currently a hotly debated topic \citep[see,
\eg,][]{Blanc:2015hl,Dopita:2013bj}.  Here we are primarily interested in relative metallicity measurements.  Even though the
absolute measurements of metallicity may change if we used a different calibration, the gradients and morphological features in
the maps should be more robust to changes in the calibration. We will restrict our comparisons with other samples to only include
studies assuming the M08 calibrations.

Unlike previous work in which calibrated relations are applied to
various EL flux ratios \citep[see, \eg,][]{PerezMontero:2014jh,Bianco:2015hn}, we design a Bayesian statistical approach which
uses directly the individual EL fluxes as input, such that the information from one EL is only used once.
Our approach presents several advantages over those based on line flux ratios.
First, it properly accounts for flux uncertainties for lines that are weak
or undetected. Second, multiple lines can be taken into consideration
without the risk of double counting any information.

Our approach simultaneously infers gas-phase metallicity (\oh),
nebular dust extinction ($\Av^{\rm N}$), and expected de-reddened \Hb flux in units of $10^{-17}$\Funit.
Details of the prior assumptions applied to these parameters are explained in Table~\ref{tab:param}.
For values of these three parameters we can compute the expected line
fluxes, and compare with measured values to compute the likelihood and
then the posterior probability.
The \chisq statistic in our inference procedure is calculated as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:chi2}
    \chisq = \sum_i \frac{\(f_{\el{i}} - R_i \cdot f_{\Hb}\)^2}
        {\(\sigma_{\el{i}}\)^2 + \(f_{\Hb}\)^2\cdot\(\sigma_{R_i}\)^2}.
\end{equation}
Here \el{i} denotes the set of emission lines \OII, \Hg, \Hb, \OIII, \Ha, and \SII. $f_{\el{i}}$ and $\sigma_{\el{i}}$ represent 
the observed de-reddened \el{i} flux and its uncertainty given a value of $\Av^{\rm N}$. We adopt the \citet{1989ApJ...345..245C} 
galactic extinction curve with \Rv=3.1.
$R_i$ is the dust-corrected flux ratio between \el{i} and \Hb, with $\sigma_{R_i}$ being the associated intrinsic scatter.
Note that the content of $R_i$ varies depending on the corresponding \el{i} in the following ways.

\indent\textbullet~ For $\el{i} \in \{\Ha,~\Hg\}$, $R_i$ corresponds to the Balmer decrement. We use the intrinsic Balmer ratios 
of $\Ha/\Hb=2.86$ and $\Hg/\Hb=0.47$, appropriate for case B recombination and fiducial \HII region conditions \citep[see, 
\eg,][]{Hummer:1987ed}. We set $\sigma_{R_i}=0$, assuming the intrinsic Balmer ratios are fixed with no scatter.
These ratios are proxies of the nebular dust extinction $\Av^{\rm N}$.

\indent\textbullet~ For $\el{i} \in \{\OII,~\OIII\}$, $R_i$ and $\sigma_{R_i}$ are taken from the M08 calibrations.
These ratios are diagnostics of the oxygen abundance \oh.

\indent\textbullet~ For $\el{i} = \SII$, we compute the values of $R_i$ and $\sigma_{R_i}$ using the Balmer ratio of $\Ha/\Hb$ and 
our new calibration of the ratio $\SII/\Ha$, derived following \citet{2015ApJ...813..126J}. \citet{2015ApJ...813..126J} used the 
same data as the low-metallicity calibrations of M08.
Although M08 do not provide any calibrations for \SII, we expect our calibration to be self-consistent and reliable for
$\oh\lesssim8.4$. \SII/\Ha is primarily useful as a diagnostic to differentiate between the
upper and lower branches of the \OIII/\Hb calibration. This is valuable because \NII is not
directly measured and \OII is typically low signal-to-noise in the lower redshift galaxies
for which \SII is available, due to decreasing grism throughput at $\lambda<0.9$ \micron.

\indent\textbullet~ For $\el{i} =$ \Hb, $R_i = 1$ with $\sigma_{R_i}=0$. This is just comparing the observed and expected \Hb 
flux, corrected for dust extinction.

\noindent
These EL flux ratios can be computed given a value of \oh, using a universal polynomial functional form, \ie, $\log{R} = 
\sum_{i=0}^{5}c_i\cdot x^i$, where $x=\oh-8.69$.
We summarize the coefficients ($c_i$) for each ratio diagnostic used in our statistical inference in Table~\ref{tab:ELratioCoef}.

In addition, the \NII/\Ha ratio is included as an additional parameter for galaxies at
$z\lesssim1.5$ where these lines are observed. However we do not attempt to determine \NII/\Ha using
the M08 calibrations, as locally-calibrated diagnostics tend to underestimate the \NII/\Ha
ratio in high-$z$ galaxies whereas oxygen and other $\alpha$-element line ratios remain
constant with redshift \citep{2014ApJ...795..165S,2015ApJ...801...88S,2015ApJ...813..126J}.
Instead we either leave this parameter free (``extended'' priors), or fixed to $\NII/\Ha=0.05$
(``vanilla'' priors).  The vanilla value is typical of galaxies with
similar $z$ and oxygen EL ratios as our sample.  Fixing the value of $\NII/\Ha$ provides
faster convergence and does not significantly affect the inferred metallicity.  We therefore
report constraints for the ``vanilla'' parameter set. For galaxy ID 04054, the
SN Refsdal host galaxy, we fix its \NII/\Ha to be 0.11, as measured by \citet{Yuan:2011hj}.

%The primary goal of the Bayesian inference is to determine metallicities. The posterior probability density distribution for
%metallicity is obtained after marginalizing over nuisance parameters, \ie,
%\begin{equation}
%    \cP(\oh) = \iint \exp(-\chisq/2) \cdot \cP_\textrm{prior}(f^\theo_{\Hb}) \d f^\theo_{\Hb} \cdot
%    \cP_\textrm{prior}(\Av^{\rm N}) \d \Av^{\rm N}.
%\end{equation}
We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler \emc \citep{ForemanMackey:2013io} to
explore the parameter space, setting the number of walkers to 100 with 5,000 iterations for each walker,
and a burnin of 2,000. The autocorrelation times are computed for
each parameter and are used to make sure chains have converged.
An example constraint result for the SN Refsdal host galaxy's global EL fluxes is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:corner}.
While this work is primarily concerned with gas-phase metallicities, our method simultaneously provides constraints on $\Av^{\rm N}$ and
SFR which can be compared to the results of SED fitting.
We then calculate the lensing-corrected de-reddened \Ha luminosity from $f_{\Hb}$ (assuming the fiducial Balmer ratio) and the 
magnification estimate of the source.
Then the instantaneous SFR can be derived, via the commonly-used calibration of \citet{Kennicutt:1998ki,Moustakas:2010ke}, \ie,
\be
    {\rm SFR} = 4.6\times10^{-42}~ \frac{L(\Ha)}{\rm erg/s} \quad [\Msun/\textrm{yr}],
\ee
valid for a \citet{Chabrier:2003ki} IMF. This SFR estimate does not rely on any assumptions about \sfh, and thus is a more direct 
measure of ongoing star formation than values given by SED fitting.

We apply this inference procedure to both galaxy-integrated line
fluxes (to be discussed in Section~\ref{sect:global}) as well as
individual spaxels in the EL maps (which will lead to \mgms described

\section{Global Demographic Properties}\label{sect:global}

Based upon the Bayesian analysis, we obtain the global measurements of \gpm, nebular dust extinction, and SFR, for all sources in
our sample, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:srcprop}. First, we check for the presence of any active galactic nucleus (AGN)
contamination in our sample. Because not all galaxies in our sample reside in the redshift range where all BPT lines are
available, we resort to the mass-excitation diagram showing the \OIII/\Hb flux ratio as a function of \Mstar, first proposed by
\citet{Juneau:2011fz} to differentiate \sf galaxies and AGNs in local Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations.
\citet{Juneau:2014ca} further revised the demarcation scheme by applying line luminosity evolution and selection effects to a more
complete SDSS galaxy sample, and tested that this scheme agrees well with the bivariate distributions found in a number of
high-$z$ galaxy samples.
According to the \citet{Juneau:2014ca} classification scheme, all but one galaxy (ID 02607) have a negligible probability of being
AGN (see Figure~\ref{fig:MEx}).
Recently, \citet{Coil:2015dp} found that a +0.75 dex \Mstar shift in the \citet{Juneau:2014ca} scheme is required to avoid serious
AGN contamination in the \mosdef galaxy sample at $z\sim2.3$.
We verified that galaxy 02607 can still be safely classified as an AGN candidate, even considering the \citet{Coil:2015dp} shifted
classification scheme.
Because the M08 calibrations originate from \HII region observations and theoretical models, not designed for AGNs, our method
will not predict a reliable metallicity constraint for the AGN candidate ID 02607. We thereby exclude this source in the rest of
our population analysis. For the rest of our sample, comprising 13 star-forming galaxies, the constraint on \gpm is robust.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/MEx.pdf}
    \caption[Mass excitation diagnostic diagram.]{Mass excitation diagnostic diagram for our \mg sample. The curves are the
    demarcation lines updated by \citet{Juneau:2014ca}. The regions below the green curve
    have a low probability ($<10\%$) of being classified as AGNs, whereas galaxies located above the red curve are secure AGN
    candidates. In our sample, the only AGN candidate,  \ie, ID 02607, is marked by a square.}
    \label{fig:MEx}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:SFMS}, we plot the measured SFR as a function of \Mstar for our sample. In comparison, the loci of
mass-selected galaxies observed by the \kd survey and the ``\sfms'' \citep[SFMS,][]{Whitaker:2014ko,Speagle:2014dd} at similar
redshifts are also shown. We can see that selecting lensed galaxies based upon EL strength can probe deep into the low-mass regime
at high redshifts that is currently inaccessible to mass complete surveys. As expected, our emission line selected targets probe 
the
upper envelope of the SFMS, so that a detail comparison is non-trivial and should take into account the selection functions of
each sample. The advantage of the emission line selection technique is that it is the most cost-effective way to obtain gas
metallicities for stellar masses down to 10$^7$ \Mstar at $z\sim2$. Using the same technique, we discovered an analog of local
group dwarf spheroidals \citep[\eg, Fornax,][]{Coleman:2008ca} at $z=1.85$ experiencing active star formation (with 1 dex offset
from the SFMS), in our previous work \citep{2015AJ....149..107J}.

\end{figure}


We also collect all published \gpm measurements in emission-line galaxies in the redshift range of our sample
$1.2\lesssim z\lesssim2.3$, obtained exclusively from the strong EL calibrations
prescribed by M08. The reason we only select measurements based upon
the M08 calibrations is that adopting different strong EL calibrations
can give rise to different absolute metallicity scales offset by up to
$\sim$0.7 dex at the high-mass end, according to the comparative study conducted by
\citet{Kewley:2008be}.  In order to minimize the systematic uncertainty associated with EL
calibrations, we thus focus on this homogeneous M08 sample alone.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MZR}, the M08-based sample includes five galaxies from
\citet{2011MNRAS.413..643R}, seven from
\citet{Wuyts:2012gb}, six from \citet{Belli:2013cn}, four
stack measurements by \citet{Henry:2013gx}, three interacting galaxies
at $z=1.85$ analyzed by \citet{2015AJ....149..107J}, and 13
star-forming galaxies presented in this work.  In total, this sample
consists of 38 independent measurements at $1.2\lesssim z\lesssim2.3$, with median
redshift $z_{\rm median}=1.84$. The mutual agreement
between our sample and that from the literature provides an
independent confirmation that our new Bayesian method leads to
constraints on \gpm consistent with previous studies also adopting
the same calibrations.  With the combined sample we
are able to derive the MZR at this redshift, spanning three orders of magnitude in stellar
mass.

We fit the following functional form to this sample of 38 galaxies in order to derive the
MZR, \ie,
\begin{equation}
    \oh = \alpha\log\(\Mstar/\Msun\) + \beta + N(\sigma),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\sigma$ represent the slope, the intercept and the intrinsic
scatter, respectively.
The Python package \linmix\footnote{available at \url{https://github.com/jmeyers314/linmix}}
was employed to perform a Bayesian linear regression following the method proposed by \citet{Kelly:2007bv}. The median values and
1-$\sigma$ uncertainties for these three parameters drawn from the marginalized posteriors are
\begin{equation}
    \alpha=0.40^{+0.07}_{-0.07},~~\beta=4.71^{+0.62}_{-0.64},~~\sigma=0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}.
\end{equation}
The resulting MZR together with its 1-$\sigma$ confidence region is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:MZR}.

    \label{fig:MZR}
\end{figure}

Recently, \citet{Guo:2016wk} presented a comprehensive study of the MZR and its scatter at
$z$=0.5-0.7 from data acquired by large spectroscopic surveys in the \candels fields
\citep{Grogin:2011hx,Koekemoer:2011br}. \citet{Guo:2016wk} also summarized a variety of
theoretical predictions of the MZR slope (\ie $\alpha$) given by diverse approaches.
The slopes predicted by the energy-driven wind ($\alpha\sim0.33$) and the momentum-driven wind ($\alpha\sim0.17$)
equilibrium models proposed by \citet{2008MNRAS.385.2181F,2012MNRAS.421...98D} are shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:MZR}.
We see that our inferred slope is only marginally compatible with the prediction given by the
energy-driven wind model at 1-$\sigma$ confidence level, whereas strongly disfavors the
momentum-driven wind model. Considering the majority of the galaxies in our sample have
relatively lower masses, our result confirms the finding by \citet{Henry:2013gx} that
momentum-driven winds cannot be the primary workhorse that shapes the MZR in the low-mass
regime (below 10$^{9.5}$ \Msun) at $z\gtrsim1$.

Our constrained value of $\alpha$ is consistent at 1-$\sigma$ confidence level with that given by \citet{Ma:2016gw}, from the FIRE 
(Feedback in Realistic Environment) cosmological zoom-in simulations \citep{GalaxiesonFIREFe:2014dn}. Evaluated at $z=z_{\rm 
median}$, their MZR reads $\oh = 0.35 \log\(\Mstar/\Msun\) + 4.87$.
The FIRE simulations reaches a spatial resolution as high as 1-10 pc, 1-2 orders of magnitude better than that in conventional
large-volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulations \citep[\eg][]{2013MNRAS.434.2645D}. The high spatial resolution
enables a more realistic and self-consistent treatment of multiphase ISM, star formation,
galactic winds and stellar feedback, than those in semi-analytic models \citep[see][for a
recent review]{2015ARA&A..53...51S}.  As a result, these zoom-in simulations are capable of
reproducing many observed relations, \eg, the galaxy stellar mass functions, the evolution of
cosmic SFR density and specific SFR (sSFR).
The consistency between the slopes of our MZR and that by \citet{Ma:2016gw} indicates that small-scale physical processes are 
important in producing the cumulative effects of galactic feedback.
However, we note that there is a 0.16 dex offset in the values of the MZR intercept ($\beta$). One possible cause is that the 
absolute metallicity scale in the M08 calibrations is offset. As shown by \citet{Kewley:2008be}, the intercepts given by different 
metallicity calibrations can vary up to 0.7 dex. Other potential causes lie in the assumptions adopted by the \citet{Ma:2016gw} 
simulations, \eg, the stellar yield is too small, the gas fractions in their simulated galaxies are too high, \etc.
Nevertheless, a discrepancy of 0.1-0.2 dex is not unusual given the uncertainties in stellar yield and metallicity calibrations.

Aiming at testing the validity of the FMR using the M08-based sample at $z\sim1.84$ compiled
in this work, we calculate the predicted values for metallicity from the measurements of
\Mstar and SFR, according to Eq.~(2) in \citet{Mannucci:2011be}, who extended the FMR to
masses down to $10^{8.3}\Msun$.
Figure~\ref{fig:FMR} shows the difference between the FMR-predicted
values and the actual measurements of metallicity.  We find that the entire
M08-based sample is consistent with the FMR given the measurement
uncertainties and intrinsic scatter. The median offset for the entire
sample is 0.07 dex, with median uncertainty 0.14 dex.
The median offset and uncertainty for our galaxy sample analyzed in this work are $-0.07$ dex and 0.12 dex, respectively. Among
other individual datasets, the only one that shows a
marginally significant deviation from the FMR is that by
\citet{Wuyts:2012gb}, which has median offset 0.22 dex and median
uncertainty 0.11 dex. We speculate that it is due to the fact that the
\citet{Wuyts:2012gb} dataset is the only one in our compiled M08-based
sample which relies solely upon the \NII/\Ha flux ratio, which can be
a biased tracer of metallicity at high redshifts \citep{2015ApJ...801...88S,Sanders:2015gk}.
This result reiterates the necessity of combining multiple EL flux ratio diagnostics
simultaneously in order to suppress the systematics associated with local calibrations in the
accurate measurement of high-$z$ metallicity.

\section{Spatially Resolved Analysis}\label{sect:sra}

In this section, we present and discuss in depth the new and unique results obtained from the spatially resolved analysis of our
sample, beyond the reach of the conventional integrated measurements in Section~\ref{sect:global}.
The high spatial resolution maps of \gpm from \hst grism spectroscopy are described in Sect~\ref{subsect:oh12grad}.
We make notes on individual galaxies in Section~\ref{subsect:indvd}.
The maps of EL kinematics on part of our sample are presented in Appendix~\ref{sect:kinem}.

To estimate the spatial distribution of the constrained parameters we apply the analysis
described in Section~\ref{sect:global} to each individual spaxel in the EL maps.
In Figure~\ref{fig:oh12grad}, we show the maps of best-fit
metallicity and the corresponding conservative uncertainty (the larger side of asymmetric
error bars given by the Bayesian inference) measured for galaxies in our \mg sample.  We bin
spaxels 2 by 2 to regain the native WFC3/IR pixel scale.
In the maps, we only include spaxels with at least one EL
(primarily \Ha or \OIII) detected with $\geq5\sigma$ significance. The \mgs measured from
these individual spaxels are shown in the right column of Figure~\ref{fig:oh12grad}. We also
measure \mgs using another independent method, \ie, via radial binning.  The range of each
radial annulus is determined by requiring its SNR $\gtrsim15$.  In
order to avoid biasing toward low metallicities, we put the SNR threshold on \Ha whenever
available (\ie $z\lesssim1.5$) instead of on \OIII, since the latter correlates tightly with
\oh, in the lower branch of \OIII/\Hb, where the majority of our sample resides.  Based upon
our SNR threshold criterion, three sources in our sample, IDs 02918, 05422 and 07058, do not
have enough spaxels to constitute a trustworthy metallicity map, and therefore were removed from the \sra.
So in total, we present 10 star-forming galaxies with sub-kpc resolution \mms.
In order to measure radial gradients, we perform Bayesian linear regressions in the same manner as described in 
Section~\ref{sect:global}.
We take into account the conservative uncertainties for individual metallicity constraints in each spaxel or annulus.
The resulted \mgs are given in Table~\ref{tab:oh12grad}.
We note that the metallicity maps are not always symmetric around
the center of stellar mass. Therefore, while gradients are a useful statistic to describe the overall behavior and to compare with
numerical simulations, they do not contain all the available information about the apparent diversity of morphologies.  Thus, it
is helpful to keep the 2D maps in mind while interpreting the gradients.

    that unlike what we show in the combined EL maps (Figures~\ref{fig:multiP_4054} and

    panels in the right column, blue and red points correspond to metallicity measurements
    for individual spaxels and radial annuli, respectively.  The radial gradients derived
    based upon these measurements are shown by the dashed lines in corresponding colors.  The

As a result, seven galaxies have gradients consistent with being flat at 2-$\sigma$, among which three show almost uniformly
distributed metals (IDs 02806, 03746 and 05968), two have marginally positive gradients (IDs 01422 and 05732), and the other two
display mildly negative gradients (IDs 02389 and 04054). Apart from these, the other three galaxies in our sample have very steep
negative gradients: IDs 07255, 05709 and 05811. In particular, after the lensing magnification correction, the stellar mass of
galaxy ID 05709 is estimated to be $\sim10^{7.9}$ \Msun. This is for the first time sub-kpc scale spatially resolved analysis has
been done on such low-mass systems at high redshifts.

In order to verify that our results are not contaminated by ionizing radiation from AGN, we
examine spatially resolved BPT diagrams. This approach is only possible for sources at
$z\lesssim1.5$, where \Ha is detectable. Furthermore, due to the low spectral resolution of
\hst grisms, we slightly modify the BPT diagram to plot flux ratio of \OIII/\Hb as a function
of \SII/\Ha+\NII, using the ``vanilla'' value for \NII/\Ha. As Figure~\ref{fig:BPT} shows, we
do not identify any strong correlation between source plane galactocentric radius and
deviation from the \HII region loci, suggesting that there is no AGNs hidden in the center of
these galaxies.
Moreover, the integrated EL fluxes of all three galaxies lie in close proximity to the
extreme starburst model prescribed by \citet{Kewley:2006ib}, which confirms our working assumption that AGN contributions are
negligible for our sample, except in one case (\ie ID 02607, see Figure~\ref{fig:MEx}).

We also test our metallicity estimates using the pure empirical EL calibrations based on a large sample of ``direct'' metallicity 
determinations in SDSS local \HII regions recently published by \citet{Curti:2016fn}, in replacement of the M08 hybrid EL 
calibrations. It is found out that our results on integrated metallicities and \mgs of the galaxies in our sample remain 
unaffected.

The radial range where \mgs are measured is critical since \HII regions at far outer/inner regions of galaxies are found to show 
significantly elevated/truncated oxygen abundances \citep[see \eg][]{2014A&A...563A..49S}.
A reasonable radial range for \mgms is believed to be between the disk effective radius \citep{Freeman:1970eb,2014A&A...563A..49S} 
and the optical radius \citep{Molla:2005eq,Molla:2016be}, \ie, roughly twice the size of disk effective radius.  We verified that 
all our \mgs are derived in this radial range, which enhances the significance of the comparative studies (of our measurements at 
least) presented in Sections~\ref{subsubsect:gradVSz} and \ref{subsubsect:gradVSm}.

    similar to what we show in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12grad}, all spaxels represented by colored

    {Evolution of metallicity gradients with redshift. The blue stars represent
    the \mgs measured in this work, and the cyan hexagon is from our previous work
    \citep{2015AJ....149..107J}. We include all the high-$z$ \mgms
    with sub-kpc resolution in the current literature: lensed galaxies analyzed by
    \citet{Frye:2012dr}, \citet{2013ApJ...765...48J}, and \citet{2015arXiv150901279L}, non-lensed
    galaxies observed with AO \citep{2012MNRAS.426..935S}.
    The spread of the \kd measurements obtained with seeing-limited conditions \citep{Wuyts:2016th} is marked as grey 
    shaded regions.
    We also show the averages of local \mgs \citep{Rupke:2010cg}, and the trend of the Milky Way gradient evolution based upon 
    planetary nebula estimates \citep{Maciel:2003kv}.
    Except for the blue stars, hollow and filled symbols correspond to interacting/merging
    and isolated systems, respectively.
    In addition, the predictions from different analytical chemical evolution models and
    numerical simulations are also shown as comparisons to the observational results (see
    Section~\ref{subsect:oh12grad} for more details).}
    \label{fig:oh12gradVSz}
\end{figure}

We plot the evolution of metallicity gradient across cosmic time in
Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}. Here we include all existing high-$z$ gradient measurements
obtained with sufficiently high spatial sampling, \ie finer than \kpc resolution in the
source plane. Together with the 10 new \mgms from the individual spaxel method presented
here, in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}, we show one highly magnified galaxy of an interacting
triple at $z$=1.85 analyzed in our previous work \citep{2015AJ....149..107J}.  We also
include 11 measurements by \citet{2015arXiv150901279L} (5 isolated and 6 merging), 4 by
\citet{2013ApJ...765...48J} (3 isolated and 1 merging), 1 sub-\Lstar post-merger at $z\sim1$
by \citet{Frye:2012dr},
%1 isolated grand-design spiral at $z$=1.49 by \citet{Yuan:2011hj},
and 7 data points from \citet{2012MNRAS.426..935S} (5 isolated and 2 interacting). The
scatter of these high-resolution gradient measurements is $\sim$0.12 dex and $\sim$0.22 dex
at $z\sim1.5$ and $z\sim2.3$ respectively.  The spread of recent gradient measurements from
the seeing-limited \kd survey is also overlaid in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}.  Note that
the PSF FWHM given by the median seeing of their observations is 0\farcs6, which results in a
5 \kpc resolution at $z\sim2$, twice the size of the half-light radius of an \Lstar galaxy at
this redshift.  We thus only focus on interpreting the sub-kpc resolution gradient
measurements, in order to avoid possible biases toward null values associated poor spatial
sampling \citep[see, \eg,][]{2013ApJ...767..106Y}.  Although corrected for beam smearing, the
\kd gradient measurements still display small scatter than that of the high resolution
results.  When possible, we also divide each data set in terms of sources being isolated or
kinematically disturbed (\ie undergoing merging).  In part of our sample, signatures of
post-merger tidal remnants can be clearly identified, which strongly indicates that
gravitational interaction plays a key role in shaping the spatial distribution of metals in
these galaxies (IDs 02806, 03746, and 05968).

In order to compare theoretical predictions with observations, we incorporate into Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz} the predictions
for the \mg cosmic evolution from canonical chemical evolution models (CEMs) based upon the ``inside-out'' disk growth paradigm 
given by
\citet[][C01]{Chiappini:2001ds} and \citet[][M16]{Molla:2016wn,Molla:2016vb}.
C01 constructed a two-phase accretion model for galaxy
formation.  The first infall period corresponds to the formation of the dark matter halo and the thick disk, with an exponentially
declining infall rate at a fixed $e$-folding time scale ($\sim$1 Gyr).  In this phase, the infall of pristine gas is rapid and
isotropic, giving birth to a relatively extended profile of star formation.  The thin disk is formed in the second phase, where
gas is preferentially accreted to the periphery of the disk, with the $e$-folding time scale proportional to galactocentric radius
(\vsv the ``inside-out'' growth).
The foundation of M16 is \citet{Molla:2005eq}, who proposed their prescription by treating the ISM as a multiphase mixture of hot 
diffuse gas and cold condensing molecular clouds, and calibrating against different star-formation efficiencies.
%Here we show the high star-formation efficiency solution.
%The common Kennicutt-Schmidt law \citep{Kennicutt:1998id,Schmidt:1959bp} is implemented to estimate \sfr.
Popular nucleosynthesis prescriptions for type Ia/II SNe and AGB stars are employed by both to construct the yields of dominant 
isotopes (\eg H, He, C, N, O, Fe).
Improving over what is done in the \citet{Molla:2005eq} multiphase CEMs,
M16 adopted newly calibrated gas infall rates from \citet{Molla:2016be} and a variety of different prescriptions for \HI-to-\Htwo 
conversion, with the best being the ASC technique (Ascasibar et al. in prep). We thus show this model solution in the black 
dash-dot curve.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}, the majority of the high-$z$
measurements are generally compatible with both model predictions, with the M16 model showing better consistency, largely ascribed
to its more accurate assumptions of ISM structure and more realistic treatment of star formation.  Note that these chemical
evolution models do not take galactic feedback or radial gas flows into account.  So without the consideration of strong physical
mechanisms that stir and mix up the enriched gas with relatively unenriched ambient ISM, conventional analytical models are still
able to match the \mgs observed at high redshifts.

In addition to the predictions from these analytical models, we also compare our measurements
with results from numerical simulations.  First, we show the fiducial representative (\ie the
realization g15784) of the McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations
\citep[MUGS,][]{Stinson:2010ix} using the gravitational N-body and SPH code \gasoline.  This
simulation employed the ``conventional'' feedback scheme, \ie depositing $\sim$10-40\%
kinetic energy from SN explosions into heating ambient ISM. Furthermore, it adopted a high
star-formation threshold (gas particle density $>$1 cm$^{-3}$), which makes star forming
activities highly concentrated in the galaxy center at early stages of disk formation.  As a
result, a steep gradient (\ie $\gtrsim-0.2$ dex/kpc) is persisting at $z>1$ and then
significantly flattens with time.  Although greatly offset from most of the measurements (and
other theoretical predictions) as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}, this particular
evolutionary track is actually quite consistent with some of the observed steep gradients
(galaxies 07255, 05709, 05811 in our analysis).  In comparison, the same galaxy (g15784) is
re-simulated with an enhanced feedback prescription of sub-grid physics as part of the Making
Galaxies In a Cosmological Context \citep[MaGICC,][]{Stinson:2013ex} program.  A factor of
2.5 difference in the energy output rate from SN feedback diverges the evolutionary track of
\mgs given by the MUGS and MaGICC simulations, making the evolution of the MaGICC gradient
less dramatic and more similar to the M16 model solution.  This demonstrates that amplifying
the feedback strength can significantly flatten the \mgs in early star-forming galaxies
\citep{Gibson:2013jw}.
This is actually adopted by some recent studies \citep{2015arXiv150901279L,Wuyts:2016th} to
explain their \mg measurements, which are also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}.
However, as we have already mentioned, this is not the only explanation possible.

Lastly, in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}, we also show another set of numerical results, from
an ensemble of 19 galaxies in different environments (9 in isolated field and 10 in loose
groups), simulated by the \ramses Disk Environment Study \citep[RaDES,][]{Few:2012jl} using
the adaptive mesh refinement code \ramses.  Unlike what is shown for the MUGS and MaGICC
simulations (\ie just one single realization), the full range of the whole suite of RaDES
simulations is marked in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}, which provides a statistical
comparison sample, although the scatter of the RaDES simulations cannot capture the scatter
seen in actual measurements.
Generally speaking, the evolutionary trends of the abundance gradients of RaDES galaxies lie
somewhat in-between the two tracks of g15784 in MUGS and MaGICC simulations, but still quite
consistent with the majority of the high-$z$ gradient measurements.
Because no mass loading is assumed in the RaDES simulations, outflows do not play any role in
this observed consistency.
Moreover, since a lower star-formation threshold is used ($>$ 0.1 cm$^{-3}$), which is
similar to what the analytical CEMs assumed, star formation in RaDES
galaxies occurs more uniformly in the early disk formation phase.  This strongly suggests
that having more extended star formation can also result in galaxies possessing shallower
gradients, confirming the tight link between star formation profile and metallicity gradient
\citep{Pilkington:2012ib}.


\subsubsection{Mass Dependence of Metallicity Gradients}\label{subsubsect:gradVSm}

In Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSmstar}, we plot metallicity gradient as a function of stellar mass for a subset of all
gradient measurements shown in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}, where reliable \Mstar estimates are available.
Notably, in the low-mass regime of $\Mstar\lesssim10^9\Msun$, all the current sub-kpc
resolution \mgms at $z\gtrsim1$ are obtained from our work, and our measurements even extend
to below $10^8$ \Msun.
This illustrates the power of combining the space-based grism spectroscopy with
gravitational lensing as a means to recover reliable metal abundance distributions in
early star-forming disks in the low-mass regime.
From these measurements, we can tentatively observe an intriguing correlation between \Mstar and \mg:
more massive galaxies tend to have shallower (less negative) gradients.
This is consistent with the galaxy formation ``downsizing'' picture \citep[see, \eg,][]{Brinchmann:2004hy,Fontanot:2009fp} such 
that more massive galaxies are more evolved and their metal distributions flatter since they are in a later phase of disk mass 
assembly where star formation occurs in a more coherent mode throughout the disk.
This correlation between mass and gradient slope has also been seen in a variety of theoretical studies including the RaDES 
simulations \citep{Few:2012jl} and the multiphase CEMs by \citep{Molla:2005eq}.

Several groups of authors have reported a characteristic oxygen abundance gradient for nearby disk galaxies, such that the 
normalized gradient in units of dex per scale radius is approximately invariant with galaxy global properties
\citep[\Mstar, morphology, \etc; \eg ][]{2014A&A...563A..49S,Bresolin:2015fk,Ho:2015gq}.
Consequently larger and more massive galaxies have shallower gradients in physical units \citep[dex/\kpc; \eg ][]{Ho:2015gq},
as we tentatively see in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSmstar}.
We verify that 8/10 of our gradient measurements, if expressed in terms of disk effective radii, are consistent with the common 
gradient slope reported by \citet{2014A&A...563A..49S}.
This common normalized abundance gradient may reflect a more fundamental relation between local surface mass density and 
metallicity \citep[\eg ][]{Bresolin:2015fk}.
Both of these quantities decrease more rapidly with radius in smaller galaxies, in line with our ``downsizing'' picture of 
metallicity gradients.
Downsizing is further reinforced by the evolution in the size-mass relation recovered by \citet{vanderWel:2014hi}.

As a comparison, we include the linear fit to the low spatial resolution \mg measurements
from the \kd survey in the similar $z$ range \citep[see Figure 6 in][]{Wuyts:2016th}.
Since the mass completeness limit for the \kd data set is $\sim$10$^{9.7}$\Msun, 
%beyond that limit we show the extrapolation of the linear fit. As we have already seen in Figure~\ref{fig:SFMS}, 
our analysis is highly complementary to the \kd result in terms of \Mstar,
albeit our \mgs are measured at much higher spatial resolution.
However, the \kd fitting relation deviates systematically from the ``downsizing'' mass dependency of \mgs and is also in conflict 
with some sub-kpc resolution gradient measurements obtained by \citet{2013ApJ...765...48J} at over 3-$\sigma$ confidence level.
This can be attributed to possible biases associated with the low spatial resolution of the \kd observations and the small mass
range of their sample.

We also show the 2-$\sigma$ spread of the galaxy \mgs from the FIRE cosmological zoom-in simulations \citep{Ma:2016ww}.
This suite of simulations has been used to study the MZR as we discussed in Section~\ref{sect:global} \citep{Ma:2016gw}.
The simulations show a diversity of gradient behaviors at four redshift epochs ($z$=0, 0.8, 1.4, 2.0). At $z=2$, the scatter of
their simulation results can reach 0.2 dex when radial gradients are measured in the central 2 kpc region, quite consistent with
the scatter ($\sim0.22$ dex) seen in high-resolution gradient measurements at $z\sim2.3$.
However, their simulations still cannot reproduce some of the steep gradient measurements, especially some of our results in the
low-mass regime.
According to \citet{Ma:2016ww}, galactic feedback from intense starburst episodes on 0.1-1 Gyr time scale can effectively flatten 
\mgs.
Hence for the galaxies measured with steep \mgs, galactic feedback must be of limited influence, at least in affecting metal
distribution in \HII regions on such short time scale.

In short, we observe a tentative mass dependence of \mgs that low-mass galaxies have steeper gradients compared with high-mass
galaxies at high redshifts. A larger set of accurately measured and uniformly analyzed \mgs well sampled in \Mstar (in the regime
of $\Mstar\lesssim10^9\Msun$ in particular) is needed in order to fully explore the validity of the \mg ``downsizing'' picture and
whether galactic feedback plays a crucial role in altering this picture.

\subsection{Notes on Individual Galaxies}\label{subsect:indvd}

In this section, we highlight some noteworthy sources in our \mg sample. For
reference, all the measurements of global properties, metallicity gradients, and kinematic
decompositions in these sources are presented in Tables \ref{tab:srcprop},
\ref{tab:oh12grad}, and \ref{tab:kinem}, respectively.

{\bf 02389}: This is the most highly magnified source in our sample, with $\mu=43.25_{-5.78}^{+7.03}$, given by the \SJ version 3
model.  It is one of two connected double images that straddle the lensing critical curve at source redshift $z=1.89$, forming a
highly sheared arc more than 5 arcsec.  This is confirmed by the velocity shear of $\sim50$ \kms detected in both components of
the fold arc.  After lensing correction, the stellar mass of this source is $\log(\Mstar/\Msun)=8.43_{-0.07}^{+0.06}$, consistent
with the very low dynamical mass indicated by both the velocity shear and integrated velocity dispersion.  The relatively high
$V/\sigma \gtrsim 2$ of this source shows that it is a disk galaxy. The \mg is mildly negative, \ie, $-0.07\pm0.04$, consistent
with the prediction by analytical CEMs for disk galaxies at similar redshifts.
%(likely higher after accounting for beam smearing and inclination).

{\bf 02806}: This is a star-forming galaxy at $z=1.50$ with very flat \mg of $-0.01\pm0.02$.  We removed the contamination from a
marginally overlapping cluster member (with greenish color in the color composite stamp shown in Figure~\ref{fig:multiP_rest}).
Note that such a process would not be possible with seeing-limited data quality.  The \muse observation does not spatially resolve
this source well, and its \OII emission line is detected with low SNR near the red edge of \muse spectral coverage. A tentative
velocity shear is seen at low significance. The faint fuzzy elongation to the south-east of this galaxy suggests a likely recent
merging event, which accounts for its gradient being flat. (See sources 03746 and 05968 for more outstanding cases where
post-merger features can be identified.) The global metallicity of this source ($\oh=7.91^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$) is slightly lower than
the average given by the MZR at similar \Mstar, in agreement with the study of \citet{MichelDansac:2008gp} suggesting that the
infall of low-metallicity gas during mergers reduces the average metallicity.

{\bf 03746}: This is an intense starburst galaxy with $\textrm{SFR}=10.95_{-0.58}^{+1.61}$
\Msun/yr at $z=1.25$, as revealed by the BPT diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:BPT}. It also
displays a flat \mg of $-0.03\pm0.03$.  Moreover the EL maps of this source show highly
clumpy star-forming regions, which do not have direct correspondence in the broad-band
photometry.  The \muse observation gives a velocity shear of $\sim$20 \kms, and an integrated
dispersion of $\sim$60 \kms, which suggests that this system is dispersion dominated
($V/\sigma<1$).  There is an extended feature southward to the source center, which is
probably a tidal remnant, consistent with this source being in a recent post-merger phase.
Besides, given the irregularities seen in the central region of the \Mstar map, this system
is still long before dynamical relaxation, and we likely capture this merger system almost
right after the coalescence.  Therefore we conclude that the flat \mg recovered in this
system is from tidal interactions. See galaxy 05968 below for an even more outstanding
post-merger case.

{\bf 04054}: This is one of the multiple images of the SN Refsdal host galaxy, a highly magnified almost face-on spiral at
$z=1.49$. It is labeled as image 1.3 by \citet{2015arXiv151005750T}\footnote{It is located at the minimum of its lensing time
delay surface, any intrinsic variabilities in the source are observed first in this image.  Unfortunately in the case of SN
Refsdal, its image is estimated to appear $\sim$ 12 years ago, long before the deployment of WFC3.}.  Our global demographic
analysis yields the following measurements: $\log(\Mstar/\Msun)=9.64_{-0.01}^{+0.05}$, $\textrm{SFR}=16.99_{-2.80}^{+5.71}$
\Msun/yr, $\oh=8.70_{-0.11}^{+0.09}$.
Compared with the previous analysis of this galaxy \citep[][not necessarily the same image
though]{2015MNRAS.450.1812L,Rawle:2016dg}, our work benefits from a more complete wavelength coverage of imaging data (from \B to
\H bands) at a greater depth.  In particular, we used the most updated lens model, optimized specifically for this spiral galaxy
\citep{2015arXiv151005750T}, giving a reliable estimate of the magnification.
\citet{Rawle:2016dg} measured SFR$\sim$5 \Msun/yr on image 1.1 of the SN Refsdal host from \herschel IR photometry.
However their value is derived assuming a magnification factor of $\mu=23.0$, given by an older lens model for \clyi
\citep{Smith:2009cu}.
If the magnification value of $\mu=8.14$ given by the latest \glafic model is adopted instead, their measurement yields
SFR$\sim$14, comparable to our SFR measurement.
As a result, our measurements are fairly consistent with the \sfms, the MZR and the FMR at similar redshifts. Given the high
\Mstar and \oh, this galaxy is significantly evolved by $z\sim1.5$ and with the still relatively high SFR, it will likely turn
into a galaxy more massive than our Milky Way at $z=0$.  According to the kinematic map derived from the \muse spectroscopy of the
\OII EL doublet, we obtain the velocity shear to be $\sim$110 \kms (see also Figure~8 in \citet{2016ApJ...822...78G}) and the
integrated dispersion $\sim$60 \kms, in good agreement with \citet{2015MNRAS.450.1812L} who found $2v_{2.2}=118\pm6$ \kms, and
local (spatially resolved) velocity dispersion of 50$\pm$10 \kms, based upon adaptive optics data.

The measured \mg for the SN Refsdal host based upon our analysis of image 1.3 is $-0.04\pm0.02$ from the individual spaxel method,
and $-0.07\pm0.02$ from the radial annulus method. This measurement is very close to the usual abundance gradient of local 
spirals, including our Milky Way, measured from either \HII regions or planetary nebulae 
\citep{Smartt:1997fm,vanZee:1998cd,Henry:2004ds,Esteban:2015ff}.
%This indicates that main sequence spiral galaxies have comparable chemical enrichment profiles irrespective of the cosmic epoch 
%that these galaxies live in.}
It is worth noting that our measurement is not as steep as the previous result reported by \citet{Yuan:2011hj},
\ie $-0.16\pm0.02$, measured from the AO assisted \osiris IFU observation of image 1.1 of the SN Refsdal host, assuming the
\citet{2004MNRAS.348L..59P} \NII/\Ha empirical calibration.  After the discovery of SN Refsdal,
\citet{2015arXiv151209093K} obtained a 1-hr \mosfire spectra on the nuclear region and the SN explosion site in image 1.1, and
measured $\oh=8.6\pm0.1$ and $\oh=8.3\pm0.1$, respectively, using the same \NII/\Ha calibration. The spatial offset between these
two measurements in terms of galactocentric radius is $8.2\pm0.5$ \kpc, given by the \glafic model. As a result, the recent
\mosfire observations indicate a gradient being $-0.04\pm0.02$, highly consistent with our measurements.

Moreover, we obtain a robust constraint on the nebular dust extinction, \ie, $\Av^{\rm N}=0.72_{-0.23}^{+0.23}$. Compared with the
stellar dust extinction retrieved from  SED fitting, \ie, $\Av^{\rm S}=1.10_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$, we see that in this galaxy, the dust
reddening of the ionized gas in \HII regions is less severe than that of the stellar continuum (see another source, \ie ID 05968,
from which the same conclusion is drawn).  This is different from what has been assumed previously: the color excess of nebular
ELs is larger than that of the stellar continuum, \ie, $E_{\rm S}(B-V)=(0.44\pm0.03)E_{\rm N}(B-V)$ \citep{Calzetti:2000iy}.
Recently, \citet{Reddy:2015ho} conducted a systematic study of dust reddening using the early observations from the \mosdef survey
and found that only 7\% of their sample is consistent with $E_{\rm N}(B-V)\gtrsim E_{\rm S}(B-V)/0.44$. They also discovered that
as sSFR (derived from Balmer EL luminosities) increases, $E_{\rm N}(B-V)$ diverges more significantly from $E_{\rm S}(B-V)$, with
a scatter of $\sim$0.3-0.4 dex at sSFR$\sim3\times10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$, which can account for the difference we see in the total
dust attenuation (\Av) of the line and continuum emissions of this galaxy.

{\bf 05709}: This galaxy has the lowest stellar mass in our \mg sample ($\log(\Mstar/\Msun)=7.90_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$) after
lensing correction\footnote{The magnification value we used in correcting for lensing is $7.10_{-0.36}^{+0.43}$, given by the
\glafic model.  The magnification value given by the \SJ model is similar, \ie, $8.43_{-0.60}^{+0.73}$.}. This is for the first
time any diffraction-limited \mg analysis and seeing-limited gas kinematics measurement have been achieved in star-forming
galaxies with such small \Mstar at the cosmic noon. This galaxy shows a steep \mg, \ie $-0.22\pm0.05$.
The velocity shear is measured to be $\sim$25 \kms, with integrated dispersion being $\sim$20 \kms. The inferred low dynamical
mass is consistent with the result from SED fitting mentioned above. In light of the kinematic result $V/\sigma \gtrsim 1$, this
galaxy is probably a clumpy thick disk.  More interestingly, observed from a multi-perspective point of view (see
Figure~\ref{fig:multiP_rest}), this galaxy shows a clumpy star-forming region at the periphery of its disk (having a distance of
3-4 kpc to the mass center), which has a tremendous amount of line emission, yet very little stellar mass, and has low \gpm. Also
see galaxy ID 07255 for a more dramatic case.

{\bf 05968}: With a tidal tail more appreciably shown to the north-east, and almost perpendicular to the galactic plane, this
galaxy (at $z=1.48$) is safely classified as a post-merger. However note that this identification wound not be possible and this
source would have been surely classified as a thick disk due to its symmetric morphology and kinematic properties, without the
ultra deep \hff imaging data.
Compared with the \Mstar and EL maps of ID 03746, the \Mstar map of this galaxy is more smooth and EL maps less clumpy, which
indicates that merging has taken place longer before than in source ID 03746.  Still the star formation is high, \ie
$\textrm{SFR}=27.95_{-4.41}^{+4.70}$ \Msun/yr.  The global metallicity ($\oh=8.47_{-0.08}^{+0.07}$) and stellar mass
($\log(\Mstar/\Msun)=9.34_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$) are quite comparable to the MZR at similar redshifts.  The \mg, as expected for
systems which have experienced recent mergers \citep[see \eg][]{Kewley:2010eg}, is constrained to be robustly flat
($-0.01\pm0.02$).  The EL kinematic analysis yields a velocity shear of $\sim$120 \kms, and an integrated dispersion being
$\sim$75 \kms. The velocity field appears typical of intermediate-mass disk galaxies at this redshift, which infers that this
post-merger system has been significantly relaxed and regained at least some of the rotation support.  This is also one of the few
cases where robust constraints on nebular dust extinction can be derived, \ie $\Av^{\rm N}=0.23^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$, which is
less than the dust extinction of stellar continuum obtained from SED fitting $\Av^{\rm S}=0.60_{-0.01}^{+0.20}$, as already seen
in the case of ID 04054.

{\bf 07255}: This galaxy is highly consistent with the SFMS at $z=1.27$ formulated by
\citet{Speagle:2014dd}, with $\log(\Mstar/\Msun)=9.36_{-0.21}^{+0.01}$ and
$\textrm{SFR}=8.73_{-3.10}^{+3.53}$ \Msun/yr. By $z=0$, it will turn into a sub-Milky
Way-sized galaxy according to \citet{Behroozi:2013fg}.
Its slightly lower than average metallicity of $\oh=8.38_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ can be a result of
low-metallicity gas inflow, following the popular interpretation of the FMR at high $z$.
This hypothesis would also explain its slightly enhanced SFR.  In the metallicity map the
inflow can be identified with a bright star-forming clump in the lower right corner, which
consists of very little \Mstar, but is dominating in the EL maps, similar to the case of
galaxy 05709 discussed above.  This indicates that in this system, the metal enrichment time
scale is much larger than the star-forming time scale, which is in turn much larger than the
gas infall time scale. Unfortunately, at the moment we do not have EL kinematic observation
on this system.

The metallicity gradient for this galaxy is constrained to be very steep, \ie $-0.16\pm0.03$ using the individual spaxel method,
and $-0.21\pm0.03$ from the radial annulus method.  We also dissected this galaxy to separate the star-forming clump from the bulk
part and re-do the analysis. It is found that the \HII regions closely related to the clump (with at least 2.5 kpc distance to the
galaxy mass center) have significantly lower metallicity and provide more than one third of the entire star formation, \ie,
$\oh=8.04^{+0.14}_{-0.18}$, $\Av^{\rm N}<0.78$, $\textrm{SFR}=3.05^{+1.21}_{-1.10}$, compared with the quantities measured in the
bulk of the galaxy (within 2 kpc to the mass center), \ie, $\oh=8.51^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\Av^{\rm N}=0.63^{+0.59}_{-0.41}$,
$\textrm{SFR}=5.78^{+3.41}_{-2.47}$.  In both regions, EL \Ha is detected at a significance of $\gtrsim 30\sigma$.  This again
demonstrates that measurements of global quantities can be to some extent misleading, and the importance of detailed spatially
resolved information.  Cases like this galaxy should be exceedingly interesting, since their steep metallicity gradients at such
high $z$ are not predicted by current mainstream numerical simulations (equipped with strong galactic feedback) or conventional
analytical CEMs.  Through studying systems like this, we can also learn how gas is accreted into the inner
disk, and more importantly whether the accretion happens alongside star formation or long
before the gas clouds can collapse.

\section{Summary and Discussion}\label{sect:conclu}

\subsection{Summary}

In this Chapter, we took advantage of the deep \hst grism spectroscopic data, acquired by the
\glass and SN Refsdal follow-up programs, and obtain \gpm maps in high-$z$ star-forming
galaxies. The \hst grisms provide an un-interrupted window for observing the cosmic evolution
of metallicity gradients through $z$ from 2.3 to 1.2 (corresponding to the age of the
universe from roughly 2.5 to 5.5 Gyr), including the redshift range $1.7<z<2.0$, unattainable
from ground-based observations due to low atmospheric transmission. Another advantage of the
HST grisms is that multiple ELs are available within a single setup and all the potential
issues related to combining data with different setups and atmospheric conditions are
eliminated. Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item We presented 10 maps of \gpm (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:oh12grad}), measured at sub-kpc resolution in star-forming
    galaxies in the redshift range of $1.2\lesssim z\lesssim2.3$, in the prime field of \clyi.  This field is so far one of the
    deepest fields exposed by \hst spectroscopy, at a depth of 34(12) orbits of G141(G102),
    reaching a 1-$\sigma$ flux limit of 1.2(3.5)$\times$$10^{-18}$ \Funit, without lensing correction.

    \item We developed a novel Bayesian statistical approach to
    jointly constrain \gpm, nebular dust extinction, and \Ha-based
    dust-corrected star formation rate. In determining these
    quantities, our method does not rely on any assumptions about
    star-formation history, nor the conversion of dust reddening from
    stellar phase to nebular phase.  Unlike the majority of
    previous work on deriving metallicity from strong EL calibrations,
    our method does not compare directly the observed EL flux ratios
    with the calibrated ones. Instead we work directly with EL fluxes, which
    effectively avoids using redundant information and circumvents
    possible biases in the low SNR regime.

    \item The metallicity maps we obtained show a large diversity
    of morphologies. Some maps display disk-like shapes and have \mgs
    consistent with those predicted by analytical chemical evolution
    models (\ie IDs 04054, 01422, 02389, 05732), whereas other
    disk-shaped galaxies have exceedingly steep gradients (\ie IDs
    07255, 05709, 05811) and bright star-forming clumps at the
    periphery of their disks. These large-offset star-forming clumps, containing very little stellar mass, are estimated to have
    lower metallicity than the corresponding global values, which can be interpreted as an evidence for the infall of low
    metallicity gas enhancing star formation.
    We also recovered three systems with nearly uniform spatial distribution of metals (\ie IDs 02806, 03746, 05968). In these
    systems, we can identify possible signatures of post-merger tidal remnants, which suggests that the observed flat gradients
    are likely caused by gravitational interactions.

    \item Collecting all existing sub-kpc resolution \mgms at high redshifts, we study the cosmic evolution and mass dependence of 
    \mgs.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We found that predictions given by analytical chemical evolution models assuming a relatively extended
            star-formation profile in the early phase of disk growth can reproduce the majority of observed \mgs at high 
            redshifts, without involving strong galactic feedback or radial outflows. This confirms the tight link between star formation and metal enrichment.
            \item We tentatively observed an correlation between stellar mass and \mg, which is in accord with the ``downsizing''
            galaxy formation scenario that more massive galaxies are more evolved into a later phase of disk growth, where they
            experience more coherent mass assembly and metal enrichment, than lower mass galaxies.
        \end{itemize}
    A larger sample of uniformly analyzed metallicity maps well sampled in the full \Mstar range (especially in the low mass
    regime, \ie, $\Mstar\lesssim10^{9}\Msun$) at high redshifts is needed to further investigate the cosmic evolution and mass
    dependence of \mgs.

    \item We also compiled a sample of 38 global metallicity measurements all derived from the \citet{2008A&A...488..463M} EL
    calibrations in the current literature (including 13 galaxies presented in this work). This sample, at $z\sim1.8$, spans three
    orders of magnitude in \Mstar. We measured the MZR and tested the FMR using this sample.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The slope of the MZR constrained by this sample rules out the momentum-driven wind model by
            \citet{2012MNRAS.421...98D} at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level. Our MZR is consistent with the theoretical prediction
            given by recent cosmological zoom-in simulations, suggesting that high spatial resolution simulations are favorable in
            reproducing the metal enrichment history in star-forming galaxies.
            \item Given the intrinsic scatter and measurement uncertainties, we do not see any significant offset from the FMR
            except the subsample of \citet{Wuyts:2012gb}. This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the \citet{Wuyts:2012gb}
            dataset is the only subsample which relies exclusively on \NII/\Ha to estimate metallicity. We therefore advocate to
            avoid nitrogen lines when estimating \gpm in high-$z$ \HII regions.
        \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Interpretation of Flat/steep Metallicity Gradients at High Redshifts}

We now turn to the interpretation of our observed metallicity gradients and maps.
Apart from the flattening of \mgs through natural evolution of galaxies that brings the abundances of any elements in the ISM 
asymptotically to the average stellar yields at the end of the evolution everywhere in the galaxy,
there are four physical mechanisms on relatively short timescale that could significantly flatten a star-forming galaxy's 
\emph{pre-existing} negative metallicity gradient (not exclusively in high-$z$ scenarios):\\

explain the inverted gradients (lower abundances in the inner disk regions) seen in some of
the AMAZE/LSD observations \citep{Cresci:2010hr}. But we note in their observations,
the near-IR integral field spectrometer \sinf was used in seeing-limited mode.}

Besides \emph{pre-existing} negative gradients being flattened by these processes, galaxies
can also inherit a broadly flat \mg from relatively extended star-formation profile in the
early disk-formation phase and coherent mass assembly for the disk growth. Because there is
strong evidence that the mass assembly for Milky Way progenitors takes place uniformly at all
radii, maintaining almost the same \Mstar profile from $z\sim2.5$ to $z\sim1$
\citep{vanDokkum:2013fg,Morishita:2015cz}. However the uncertainties associated with current
measurements are still insufficient to distinguish numerical simulations with enhanced
feedback prescriptions from conventional analytical CEMs assuming more
uniform star formation (see Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}).

One perhaps obvious but nevertheless important caveat common to most galaxy evolution work is
that we only have access to \emph{cross-sectional} data, \ie, observations of different
objects at one specific epoch. Therefore any interpretations of plots like
Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}, which try to tie these data with \emph{longitudinal} theories
(describing the evolution of one specific object), should be made with caution.

Perhaps an even more intriguing interpretation of Figure~\ref{fig:oh12gradVSz}, which is
robust against the aforementioned caveat, is that there exist some really steep \mgs at high
$z$, such as our galaxy IDs 07255, 05709, and 05811.
Based upon current measurements, the occurrence rate of high-$z$ \mgs more negative than $-0.1$ dex/kpc is 5/34.
We can derive the following constraints on the physical processes that can contribute to
these steep \mgs observed beyond the local universe:\\
\indent\textbullet~galactic feedback (including supernova explosions and stellar winds) must
be of limited influence (via being confined for instance), \\
\indent\textbullet~star-formation efficiency is low, or at least lower than their local
analogs (in simulations, this can be achieved by having a higher star-formation threshold or
less concentrated molecular gas, as shown by the MUGS runs), \\
\indent\textbullet~star formation at early times is highly centrally
concentrated, and the mass assembly of the inner regions is much faster than that of the outer regions, \\
\indent\textbullet~alternatively, steep gradients are the result of low-metallicity
gas falling onto the outskirts of their disks, implying that the dynamic time scale is much
shorter than the star-forming time scale, which is much shorter than the metal enrichment
time scale, as seen in our galaxy 07255.

We need larger samples with robust measurements in order to more accurately quantify the
occurrence rate of these steep \mgs in high-$z$ star-forming disks.
The existence of a distinct population of galaxies with steep \mgs, if confirmed by future
observations constraining their abundance, is a powerful test of galaxy formation models,
because this is not predicted by most current theoretical models.
Hence, these galaxies with steep \mgs should be the prime targets for new numerical
predictions: future \jwst observations will constrain their properties in great detail,
allowing discriminating tests of current theories.

Furthermore, most current numerical simulations are aimed at reproducing present-day Milky
Way analogs, surrounded by a dark matter halo with Virial mass $\sim10^{12}\Msun$. It would
be useful to have large samples of simulated sub-\Lstar galaxies (\Mstar below
$5\times10^9\Msun$ at $z\sim2$) in order to investigate how metals are recycled in these less
massive systems and provide a more suitable comparison to our \mgms at high $z$.  With
improvements on both the observational and theoretical sides, we will be able to answer why
in these high-$z$ star-forming disk galaxies, the \mgs can be established so early and why
they are so steep compared with those found in local analogs.

\section{Emission line kinematics from ground-based IFU observations}\label{sect:kinem}

When available, we use ground based spectroscopic IFU data
to investigate the 2D kinematics of the sources for which we obtain
metallicity maps from the \hst grism data.  A first
set of ground-based data were obtained in 2015 with the instrument
\muse on the \vlt, taken as part of the Director's Discretionary Time
program 294.A-5032 (P.I. Grillo) aimed at assisting
with the modeling of SN Refsdal.  The \muse pointing is denoted
by the green square in Figure~\ref{fig:RGBfullFoV}.  The observations,
data reduction, first results, and applications to the host galaxy of
Refsdal and mass modeling of the cluster are described by \citet{2016ApJ...822...78G,Karman:2016cg}.
Five objects in our \mg sample fall within the \muse pointing, with one on the edge of the FoV.
Hence four maps showing complete kinematic structures can be extracted for sources IDs 02389, 02806, 03746, and 04054.
A second set of ground based observations were obtained with the instrument \kmos also on the
\vlt, as part of our \glass follow-up \kmos Large Program 196.A-0778 (P.I. Fontana). Two objects (IDs 05709 and 05968) in our
sample were targeted with the deployable IFUs, using the YJ grating.
The observations, data reduction, and first results from this program are described by \citet{Mason:2016ww}.
Thanks to lensing magnification, we push for the first time the mass limit of EL kinematic analyses to below $10^8\Msun$ (see Table~\ref{tab:kinem}).

Kinematic information is valuable for interpreting \mgs and their evolution. We derive gas-phase kinematics for the aforementioned 
galaxies, by fitting the strongest available emission feature. This is typically \CIII$\lambda\lambda$1907,1909,
\OII, or \OIII$\lambda\lambda$4960,5008. We fit each doublet as a
sum of two Gaussian components with equal velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) and redshift, plus a
constant continuum level. The fits are weighted by the inverse-variance spectrum estimated
from sky regions in the data cubes. Best-fit values for the spatially integrated spectra are
given in Table~\ref{tab:kinem}. The intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm int}$ is calculated by subtracting the instrument
resolution (determined from sky ELs) in quadrature from the observed best-fit velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm obs}$.
For \CIII and \OII we determine the best-fit doublet ratio of
the integrated spectra, while the \OIII doublet ratio is fixed to its intrinsic atomic value.
For individual spaxels, we fix the doublet ratios to their integrated values in order to
avoid spurious fits. We also spatially smooth each data cube with a 3-pixel (0\farcs6) kernel
to improve SNR in the diffuse extended regions. We attempt to fit every spaxel in the
smoothed data cube surrounding each object. Bad fits are rejected on the basis of low SNR and
unrealistic values (typically requiring $20~\kms<\sigma_{\rm obs}<200~\kms$, and
velocities within 200 \kms of the integrated systemic value).  Figure~\ref{fig:kinem} shows
velocity fields of each source from all spaxels with acceptable EL fits.
We discuss the kinematics of individual galaxies in the context of their metallicity
gradients and other properties in Section~\ref{subsect:indvd}.
For purposes of this discussion, we estimate velocity shear $V_{\rm shear}$ as the total change in velocity across the kinematic major axis of each source shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kinem}. Estimates of $V/\sigma$ in the text refer to $V_{\rm shear}$.}
This quantity serves as a useful proxy for the gas orbital velocity: $V_{\rm shear} = 2 V_{\rm max} \sin i$, \ie, twice the 
observed maximum orbital velocity (not corrected for inclination).

After a careful selection, we compiled a list of sources most promising for the spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis in the 
redshift range of $z\in[1.2, 2.3]$.
For instance, we show the \glass spectra of two of these sources (one at $z\leq1.5$ with \Ha covered and the other at $z\geq1.5$ 
without \Ha) in Figures~\ref{fig:3746} and \ref{fig:2389}.
The SN Refsdal follow-up exposures, albeit only covering G141, have better SNRs compared with the spectra shown here by a factor 
of $\sqrt{15/2}$ at each PA.  Combining all the available grism exposures, we measured the EL fluxes on all our sources and 
presented the measurements in Table~\ref{tab:ELflux}.
