To explore the chemo-structural properties of galaxies and understand quantitatively the cycling of baryons at
the peak epoch of cosmic star formation, I developed a highly effective method for sub-kiloparsec scale spatially
resolved spectroscopy of strongly lensed galaxies using space-based wide-field slitless grism data. Applying this
method to the deep Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared grism data, I obtained precise gas-phase metallicity maps
of a large sample of star-forming galaxies at $1.2\lesssim z\lesssim2.3$, over half of which reside in the dwarf
mass regime.  My work presents the first statistically representative sample of high-redshift dwarf galaxies with
their metallicity spatial distribution measured with sufficient resolution.  These metallicity maps reveal a
variety of baryonic physics, such as efficient radial mixing from tidal torques, rapid accretion of
low-metallicity gas, and various feedback processes which can significantly influence the chemo-structural
properties of dwarf galaxies.  In particular, we find two galaxies at $z\sim 2$ displaying strongly inverted
metallicity radial gradients, suggesting that powerful galactic winds triggered by central starbursts carry the
bulk of stellar nucleosynthesis yields to the outskirts.
I also observe an intriguing correlation between stellar mass and metallicity gradient, consistent with the 
``downsizing'' galaxy formation picture that more massive galaxies are more evolved into a later phase of disk 
growth, where they experience more coherent mass assembly at all radii and thus show shallower metallicity 
gradients.
%Furthermore, 10\% of the metallicity gradients measured
%in our sample are inverted, which are hard to explain by currently existing hydrodynamical simulations and
%analytical chemical evolution models.
My method can also be readily applied to data from future space missions
employing grism instruments, e.g., JWST, Euclid, WFIRST, CSST.
